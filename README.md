Algorithms and Heuristic Approaches for Solving the 8-Puzzle and NxN Variants

# Brief Description
This project explores various algorithms and heuristics to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem and extends these approaches to larger NxN puzzles. The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space, and the goal is to rearrange the tiles in numerical order using the blank space. We implemented both informed and uninformed search algorithms, including A* with different heuristics such as Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance. Our results showed that A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic was the most efficient in terms of time and moves. The project also highlights the challenges encountered, such as unsolvable start states and the computational complexity of larger puzzles. We developed an interactive user interface to facilitate easy experimentation and automated data collection for performance analysis.
